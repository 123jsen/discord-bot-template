# Discord Game

A discord bot template

## Installation

Make sure that Node.JS and yarn is installed in your computer. If yarn is not installed, type `npm install -g yarn` in your console.

After you clone the repo to a folder on your machine, type `yarn` at the project directory to download all required packages from NPM servers.

## Setup Discord Bot and developers settings

Follow `https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin` for the setup.

## Setup `.env`

Create `.env` at the project folder with the following fields:

```
CLIENT_ID
GUILD_ID
MONGODB_URI
CLIENT_TOKEN
```
## Running the bot

For each new server, `yarn commands` or `npm run commands` need to be run at least once to register all the commands. Run again if commands are changed. This command will execute `src/initialization/deploy-commands.js`, which will register commands at discord guild.

If `GUILD_ID` is missing in `.env`, then commands will be registered globally instead of at one server only.
